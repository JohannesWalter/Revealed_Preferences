## 4. Current Population Characteristics
## 5. Earnings Beliefs

###    5.1 Earnings Levels
        - How do students think capital investment will influence their own future earnings? These are the self-beliefs. Asked to consider future degrees as well.Asked to consider no inflation.

        - the qualitative patterns are similar in that the students in our sample expect substantially higher earnings in business and science majors relative to humanities, and higher earnings in humanities than if they were not to graduate.
###    5.2 Earnings Return
        - del_i = ln(E_i(w_it(k))) - ln(E_i(w_it(k0)))
        - del_i can be positive if the individual perceives a positive return to human capital
        investment k over k0,
        
###    5.3 Earnings Growth
        - - The students in our sample expect large earnings growth in the early part of their
        career
###    5.4 Earnings Uncertainty
        - The average standard deviations are similar for science/business and humanities fields and for the two genders
        - College degrees and business/science degrees are perceived to not only bring higher expected earnings, but also lower earnings uncertainty
## 6. Beliefs about Marriage and Spousal Characteristics
     
###    6.1 Marriage Probabilities
        - The top panel of Table 6 shows that the average probability of being married (unconditional on human capital, that is, “overall”) grows from between 15-18 percent shortly after graduation (about age 23), to around 59-63 percent at age 30, and to about 80 percent by age 45.
        - Examining beliefs by type of human capital, the average expected marriage probabilities at age 30 and 45 are generally lower for the no degree field than for the other two fields, for both genders.
        - Panel B of Table 6 indicates that women believe that completing a degree in science or business rather than in humanities or social sciences reduces their chances of being married at age 23 by nearly 10 percent.
        - This finding indicates that women believe that choosing a more technical college major in science or business would likely cause them to delay marriage, but that marriage rates at age 45 would be about the same no matter what their college major.
###    6.2 Marital Sorting: Potential Spouse’s Earnings
        - emphasized to respondents that they were to report beliefs about their spouse’s earnings conditional on their own major, not the potential spouse’s major (page 27 pdf)
        - beliefs about spouses’ earnings are generally lower than own earnings for male students, while female students believe their spouse’s earnings will exceed their own earnings
        - These qualitative general patterns are consistent with the realized data on currently married couples as revealed in the ACS
        - Average spousal earnings returns are positive for major choice (science or business relative to humanities) and for completing college, indicating that individuals believe their investment in higher earning majors and completing a college degree will yield not only higher own earnings but lead to matches with higher earning spouses as well
###    6.3 Marital Sorting: Assortative Mating by Education
        - Both female and male respondents expect science/business to be the modal spousal major regardless of the major they themselves graduate with. However, the table clearly shows that matching by education is perceived to be assortative
        - Overall, the perceived patterns are consistent with the well-documented fact that there is assortative mating by education
## 7. Beliefs about Fertility
        - Two mechanisms could be at work: 
                1.) increasing demand for children because more income and children are a normal good or decreasing demand through "child quality quantity" trade-off.
                2.) depending on your major you get a job that is easy or difficult to combine with having children
        - The expected fertility by age 45 is 1.7 children for men and 1.8 children for women. This level of fertility is reasonable and quite similar to the actual average fertility rate in the United States (1.9 births per woman).
        - completing a college degree, relative to no degree, is believed to nearly double their expected number of children. The beliefs of the students in our sample are consistent with the idea that children are a normal good, and the anticipated loss of income from not completing a college degree reduces the demand for children. However, this belief runs counter to the well-known pattern that fertility declines with income and education level. This pattern could also be due to a reduction in perceived marriage prospects if one were to not graduate versus complete a college degree.
## 8. Beliefs about Future Labor Supply
###    8.1 Unconditional Labor Supply
###    8.2 Labor Supply by Marital Status
## 9. Heterogeneity in Treatment Effects
###    9.1 Treatment Effects by Major
###    9.2 Treatment Effects by School Year
## 10. Beliefs and Human Capital Choices
## 11. Beliefs and Realized Outcomes: Results from a Follow-Up
Survey
## 12. Conclusion


Questions:
    - Do they ask for the actual income at age 23?
    - How is this revealed preferences?
    - Look up on assortative matching (chap 6.3)
    - What is the actual distribution at age 23, 30, 45? And how does it compare to their expectations?

Nicolai's Notes:
Each presentation will be allocated one hour total (including questions and discussion). Team partners should coordinate presentation duties among themselves (e.g. person 1 presents the model, person 2 presents data and results, person 1 discusses limitations and future research).  Team partners should discuss the paper in advance to make sure that they share a common understanding of key details.  You should budget about 15 minutes for questions and group discussion. I will encourage the group to ask questions and make comments throughout the presentation, similar to an academic seminar. Your presentation should avoid literature review and extensive discussion of robustness checks and appendix material. Grades will be based on the quality of your presentation (both your slides and your presentation of them) and the extent to which your presentation clearly addresses the following points:
1.	What is the authors’ research question?
2.	What are the key features of the economic model?
3.	What sources of variation in the data identify key model parameters?
4.	What are the main findings and their policy implications?  
5.	What are the main limitations of the research design?
6.	Imagine that you could go back and redo the study.  How would you modify the research design to advance knowledge? For example, what additional data would you collect and how would you use it? 
    -> only high ability students -> external validity?

Some presentation tips:  practice your presentation and timing.  You may find that you do not have enough time to cover every detail.  In this case, you will need to be efficient in choosing the most important details to cover.  You may want to prepare appendix slides in anticipation of questions from the group.  

Finally, I ask that you email me a pdf copy of your slides at least 24 hours in advance of your presentation
