## 1. Introduction
## 2. Model: Beliefs and Realized Choices
###    2.1 Human Capital Investment Under Uncertainty

- Discrete and finite time horizon: $t = 1, 2, ..., T$
  
- At each $t$, individuals decide types (or levels) of human capital investment: $k = 1, 2, ..., K$

- Outcomes are future earnings, labor supply, marriage, fertility
  
- an individual's expected utility is given by: $E_{i,\tau}(V_k) = \sum_{t=\tau + 1}^T \beta^{t-\tau} \int u_t(X) \; dG_{i,\tau}(X|k,t)$, <br> 
where $X$ is a vector of possible outcomes.

- $G_{i,\tau}(X|k,t)$ is the individual's __beliefs distributions__ about the probability of future outcomes $X$. $G$ have four characteristics:
  - reflect uncertainty
  - are heterogeneous
  - can be incorrect
  - evolve over time due to learning

###    2.3 Potential Outcomes
###    2.4 Realized Outcomes
###    2.5 Summary: “Effects” of Human Capital
## 3. Data
###    3.1 Administration
###    3.2 Survey Instrument
###    3.3 Sample Selection and Descriptive Statistics

- Surveyed students were in their freshman, sophomore or junior year; potential source of heterogeneity

- Given heterogeneity between gender in their selections of college majors.
  
## 4. Current Population Characteristics
## 5. Earnings Beliefs

###    5.1 Earnings Levels
- How do students think capital investment will influence their own future earnings? These are the self-beliefs. Asked to consider future degrees as well.Asked to consider no inflation.

- the qualitative patterns are similar in that the students in our sample expect substantially higher earnings in business and science majors relative to humanities, and higher earnings in humanities than if they were not to graduate.
###    5.2 Earnings Return
- del_i = ln(E_i(w_it(k))) - ln(E_i(w_it(k0)))
- del_i can be positive if the individual perceives a positive return to human capital investment k over k0,
        
###    5.3 Earnings Growth
        - - The students in our sample expect large earnings growth in the early part of their
        career
###    5.4 Earnings Uncertainty
        - The average standard deviations are similar for science/business and humanities fields and for the two genders
        - College degrees and business/science degrees are perceived to not only bring higher expected earnings, but also lower earnings uncertainty
## 6. Beliefs about Marriage and Spousal Characteristics
     
###    6.1 Marriage Probabilities
        - The top panel of Table 6 shows that the average probability of being married (unconditional on human capital, that is, “overall”) grows from between 15-18 percent shortly after graduation (about age 23), to around 59-63 percent at age 30, and to about 80 percent by age 45.
        - Examining beliefs by type of human capital, the average expected marriage probabilities at age 30 and 45 are generally lower for the no degree field than for the other two fields, for both genders.
        - Panel B of Table 6 indicates that women believe that completing a degree in science or business rather than in humanities or social sciences reduces their chances of being married at age 23 by nearly 10 percent.
        - This finding indicates that women believe that choosing a more technical college major in science or business would likely cause them to delay marriage, but that marriage rates at age 45 would be about the same no matter what their college major.
###    6.2 Marital Sorting: Potential Spouse’s Earnings
        - emphasized to respondents that they were to report beliefs about their spouse’s earnings conditional on their own major, not the potential spouse’s major (page 27 pdf)
        - beliefs about spouses’ earnings are generally lower than own earnings for male students, while female students believe their spouse’s earnings will exceed their own earnings
        - These qualitative general patterns are consistent with the realized data on currently married couples as revealed in the ACS
        - Average spousal earnings returns are positive for major choice (science or business relative to humanities) and for completing college, indicating that individuals believe their investment in higher earning majors and completing a college degree will yield not only higher own earnings but lead to matches with higher earning spouses as well
###    6.3 Marital Sorting: Assortative Mating by Education
        - Both female and male respondents expect science/business to be the modal spousal major regardless of the major they themselves graduate with. However, the table clearly shows that matching by education is perceived to be assortative
        - Overall, the perceived patterns are consistent with the well-documented fact that there is assortative mating by education
## 7. Beliefs about Fertility
        - Two mechanisms could be at work: 
                1.) increasing demand for children because more income and children are a normal good or decreasing demand through "child quality quantity" trade-off.
                2.) depending on your major you get a job that is easy or difficult to combine with having children
        - The expected fertility by age 45 is 1.7 children for men and 1.8 children for women. This level of fertility is reasonable and quite similar to the actual average fertility rate in the United States (1.9 births per woman).
        - completing a college degree, relative to no degree, is believed to nearly double their expected number of children. The beliefs of the students in our sample are consistent with the idea that children are a normal good, and the anticipated loss of income from not completing a college degree reduces the demand for children. However, this belief runs counter to the well-known pattern that fertility declines with income and education level. This pattern could also be due to a reduction in perceived marriage prospects if one were to not graduate versus complete a college degree.
## 8. Beliefs about Future Labor Supply
###    8.1 Unconditional Labor Supply

- Gender differences in belief about labor supply at age 30, but not so much at age 45
  
- Generally male students belief that their labor supply (in terms of full-time work) will be higher over all education levels

-  For both male and female students, the belief is that full-time labor supply will be more probable when the have a degree vs. no degree, and for sci/business majors vs. humanities at age 30

-  At age 45 the differences are less pronounced, and only significant for females.

###    8.2 Labor Supply by Marital Status

- Males expectation to work full-time when married are significantly higher than females. Vice versa, females believe to be working part-time or not at all when being married.

- The gender differences are insignificant conditional on being single.

- For males, we there are no significant deviations in believes for full time work conditional on marital status, but women believe they are 18% less likely to work full-time

- For both genders, there is a positive relationship between being

## 9. Heterogeneity in Treatment Effects

###    9.1 Treatment Effects by Major

- Treatment: majoring in science/business

- Treatment effect on the treated: beliefs of students that do major in science/business

- Treatment effect on the untreated: beliefs of students that do not major in science/business

- Self earnings: business/science students expect a higher payoff of 0.66/0.56 from their majors than humanities students, which only expect 27/32 % higher earnings of the business/science majors. As it is still positive, it shows that humanities forgo payoffs on purpose.

- Students seem to select into majors in which they have a comparative advantage. Males that complete a sicence/business major perceive a 29% gain in relative rank, while women who major in humanities perceive a 50% loss were they to major in science/business.

- Consistent with the Roy model, students choose majors in which they have a comparative advantage.
  
###    9.2 Treatment Effects by School Year

- Little learning over the years is found except that freshman overestimate their ability (not in mean, but regarding the whole distribution)
  
## 10. Beliefs and Human Capital Choices

- Do beliefs drive educational choices? Specifically, not only earnings and ability, but also spousal earnings, marriage and fertility

- OLS for females: earnings and ability correlate positively with intended major; family variables are significant and reduce coefficient for earnings by 1/3

- OLS for males, family variables are insignificant and do not change the earnings coefficient

- These differences also hold for actual majors chosen in the follow-up: males took majors that they believed are positively correlated with earnings and not significant for family variables; vice versa for females.

- Females tend to incorporate family variables, including spousal earnings into consideration.


## 11. Beliefs and Realized Outcomes: Results from a Follow-Up

- How well do students' expectations predict their actual choices?

- How well can students anticipate their future careers and family life?

Outcomes vs. expectations:

- For earnings: cannot reject hypothesis that actual outcome is the same as expected.

- For labor supply: females overestimated the frequency of working part-time: belief at 30 18%; actual 9% at 25; maybe part-time work would be more common at 30 due to children

- Spouse's earnings: Female respondents’ average belief is in fact lower than the realized average, while the opposite is the case for male respondents.

- Regression of actual earnings on expected earnings: statistically significant coefficient, but only $R^2$ of 0.09, which indicated that student do not have perfect foresight regarding earnings. Futhermore, female students are a lot better at predicting future earnings than male students. Maybe overconfidence of males?


## 12. Conclusion


Questions:
    - Do they ask for the actual income at age 23?
    - How is this revealed preferences?
    - Look up on assortative matching (chap 6.3)
    - What is the actual distribution at age 23, 30, 45? And how does it compare to their expectations?

## Nicolai's Notes:
Each presentation will be allocated one hour total (including questions and discussion). Team partners should coordinate presentation duties among themselves (e.g. person 1 presents the model, person 2 presents data and results, person 1 discusses limitations and future research).  Team partners should discuss the paper in advance to make sure that they share a common understanding of key details.  You should budget about 15 minutes for questions and group discussion. I will encourage the group to ask questions and make comments throughout the presentation, similar to an academic seminar. Your presentation should avoid literature review and extensive discussion of robustness checks and appendix material. Grades will be based on the quality of your presentation (both your slides and your presentation of them) and the extent to which your presentation clearly addresses the following points:
1.	What is the authors’ research question?
2.	What are the key features of the economic model?
3.	What sources of variation in the data identify key model parameters?
4.	What are the main findings and their policy implications?  
5.	What are the main limitations of the research design?
6.	Imagine that you could go back and redo the study.  How would you modify the research design to advance knowledge? For example, what additional data would you collect and how would you use it? 
    -> only high ability students -> external validity?

Some presentation tips:  practice your presentation and timing.  You may find that you do not have enough time to cover every detail.  In this case, you will need to be efficient in choosing the most important details to cover.  You may want to prepare appendix slides in anticipation of questions from the group.  

Finally, I ask that you email me a pdf copy of your slides at least 24 hours in advance of your presentation

## Questions to answer

### 1. What is the authors’ research question?

- What do students believe about the consequences of their education choices?

- How and for what reasons do students sort into majors?

- What roles do family variables play in student's choices?

- How good can students anticipate the consequences of their choices?

   
### 2. What are the key features of the economic model?
   
### 3. What sources of variation in the data identify key model parameters?

- Gender differences
- Differences by major
- Differences by School Year

### 4. What are the main insights and policy implications?

- Family variables are significant for female students but not for males when choosing a major
- Perceived ability is significant when choosing a major.

### 5. What are the main limitations of the research design?

 - General survey problems:
   - Is the survey design affecting answers?
   - Stated vs. true preferences?
   - Thoroughness of answers?

- Outcomes are in part affected by individuals' future decisions (marriage or child decisions), which can be the result of changes in preferences rather than human capital investments. Other outcomes might be affected by outside shocks (wages)
  
- How are the evolving beliefs of individuals accounted for? A decision in period $t$ might affect beliefs in period $t+1$.
  
- p. 10: Question about _distribution_ of outcomes. How is this implemented in a manner that provides consistent answers?
  
- Asking students about their earnings at age = 30, but the "outcome elicitation" takes place when they are only 25-27. Model about the increase in earnings, marriage etc.? Linear?

### 6. Propose a research design that would advance knowledge. 
   >Imagine that you could go back and redo the study. How would you modify the research design to advance knowledge? For example, what additional data would you collect and how would you use it? What additional models would you run?

- Run follow-up sample when the students actually realize the outcomes, i.e. at age = 30 and 45.

- sample not representative; increase external validity by expanding the sample; might also elicit heterogeneity in beliefs regionally / by ability

- business and science in one category; motivations and beliefs might be a lot different for business students (extrinsic motivation, higher emphasis on earnings). Johannes' comment: Science and business are two different fields in their survey. Only in their analysis they throw them together

- Study is not causal; (field) experiment?

- Stated preferences and not consequential

- They elicit beliefs, but they don't attempt to uncover the underlying reasons for these beliefs. Understanding the reasons could be necessary for useful policy recommendations. Examle: Men and women believe men will earn more at each age. Why? Do they believe in discrimination or is it due to the anticipated lower level of labor supply? Easiest way to get to these believed reasons is to extend the survey.
