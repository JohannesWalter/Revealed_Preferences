## 5. Earnings Beliefs

###    5.1 Earnings Levels
        - How do students think capital investment will influence their own future earnings? These are the self-beliefs. Asked to consider future degrees as well.Asked to consider no inflation.

        - the qualitative patterns are similar in that the students in our sample expect substantially higher earnings in business and science majors relative to humanities, and higher earnings in humanities than if they were not to graduate.
###    5.2 Earnings Return
        - del_i = ln(E_i(w_it(k))) - ln(E_i(w_it(k0)))
        - del_i can be positive if the individual perceives a positive return to human capital
        investment k over k0,
        
###    5.3 Earnings Growth
        - - The students in our sample expect large earnings growth in the early part of their
        career
###    5.4 Earnings Uncertainty
        - The average standard deviations are similar for science/business and humanities fields and for the two genders
        - College degrees and business/science degrees are perceived to not only bring higher expected earnings, but also lower earnings uncertainty

Nicolai's Notes:
Each presentation will be allocated one hour total (including questions and discussion). Team partners should coordinate presentation duties among themselves (e.g. person 1 presents the model, person 2 presents data and results, person 1 discusses limitations and future research).  Team partners should discuss the paper in advance to make sure that they share a common understanding of key details.  You should budget about 15 minutes for questions and group discussion. I will encourage the group to ask questions and make comments throughout the presentation, similar to an academic seminar. Your presentation should avoid literature review and extensive discussion of robustness checks and appendix material. Grades will be based on the quality of your presentation (both your slides and your presentation of them) and the extent to which your presentation clearly addresses the following points:
1.	What is the authors’ research question?
2.	What are the key features of the economic model?
3.	What sources of variation in the data identify key model parameters?
4.	What are the main findings and their policy implications?  
5.	What are the main limitations of the research design?
6.	Imagine that you could go back and redo the study.  How would you modify the research design to advance knowledge? For example, what additional data would you collect and how would you use it? 
    -> only high ability students -> external validity?

Some presentation tips:  practice your presentation and timing.  You may find that you do not have enough time to cover every detail.  In this case, you will need to be efficient in choosing the most important details to cover.  You may want to prepare appendix slides in anticipation of questions from the group.  

Finally, I ask that you email me a pdf copy of your slides at least 24 hours in advance of your presentation
